The calculated seasons for the days in days.csv (both main files return the same answer):
['winter', 'winter', 'herfst', 'zomer', 'winter', 'zomer', 'winter', 'winter', 'zomer']
The ideal k-value is 37, with a success rate of 58% using old_main.py and 57% using main.py.

The difference between main.py and old_main.py is that main.py is an time-optimised version that is much faster than old_main.py, though suffers a tiny bit in accuracy.
